A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures are essential components in designing efficient algorithms and are fundamental in the management of large amounts of data, such as databases and large-scale computations.
Why Data Structures are Needed
1.	Efficiency: Efficient data structures enable faster data retrieval and modification. For example, searching for an element in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm is faster compared to a linear search in an unsorted array.
2.	Data Management: They help in managing and organizing large datasets. For instance, databases use data structures like B-trees to index and manage data.
3.	Optimization: They allow the optimization of various computational processes by minimizing the complexity of operations. For example, using a hash table can reduce the time complexity of search operations from O(n) to O(1).
4.	Data Relationships: They help in representing the relationships between data. For instance, graph data structures can represent networks, social connections, and paths in navigation systems.
5.	Reusability: Well-defined data structures can be reused across different programs, saving development time and effort.
6.	Memory Management: They help in the efficient allocation and deallocation of memory. For instance, linked lists manage memory dynamically and can grow and shrink as needed.
Types of Data Structures
•	Linear Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
•	Non-Linear Data Structures: Trees, graphs, and heaps.
•	Hash-based Structures: Hash tables.
•	File Structures: B-trees and B+ trees.
Abstract Data Type (ADT)
Definition
An abstract data type (ADT) is a model for data structures that defines the data type purely by its behavior (operations) rather than by its implementation. ADTs encapsulate the data and the operations that can be performed on the data, hiding the implementation details from the user.
Characteristics
1.	Encapsulation: ADTs encapsulate the data and the operations that can be performed on the data, presenting a clear interface to the user.
2.	Abstraction: They provide a high level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary operations.
3.	Modularity: ADTs promote modularity by allowing the separation of the interface and implementation. This makes it easier to modify the implementation without affecting the user's interaction with the data type.
4.	Reusability: ADTs can be reused in different programs and contexts, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
Examples of Abstract Data Types
•	List ADT: Defines operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal without specifying how these operations are implemented (e.g., using arrays or linked lists).
•	Stack ADT: Defines operations like push, pop, and peek. The stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
•	Queue ADT: Defines operations like enqueue, dequeue, and front. The queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
•	Tree ADT: Defines operations like insert, delete, and search. The tree can be implemented as binary trees, AVL trees, etc.
Benefits of ADTs
•	Simplicity: Users can interact with the data type without needing to understand its implementation.
•	Flexibility: Implementations can be changed without affecting the user's code.
•	Maintainability: ADTs help in maintaining and updating code by providing a clear separation between the interface and implementation.
